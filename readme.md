Introduction
------------

This application allows the user to reprice a vanilla bond using the net present value of cash flows methodology
or by using duration and convexity. This renders itself useful for stress testing based on changes in the yield curve.
 

Setup
------------

To properly run the application, you will need a python 3 environment (prefereably 3.7) with numpy, pandas, 
and matplotlib installed.


Running the Application
-------------
To run the application, open the project in your favorite IDE and activate your python environment
from above. Run the main.py file. 

If you prefer the command line, enter the directory of the project and activate your python environment
created above and run:

`
python main.py
` 

Output png files will be saved and the simulation statistics will be printed in the terminal.


Example
-----------------

Under the current settings, we reprice a vanilla bond at various increments of basis point changes in the yield. For
simplicity we instantiate the bond with the following price, face value, yield-to-maturity, coupon rate, coupon 
frequency, and years to maturity as below:

```       
Bond(price=100, face_value=100, ytm=new_ytm, coupon_rate=0.05, coupon_freq=2, years=5)

```

###Results:
We recalculate the bond price for basis point changes between -0.05 and +0.05. The BPV (DV01) is
the change in bond price from a 1 basis point change in the yield, which is annotated below.
